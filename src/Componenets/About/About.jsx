            My name is Karthik, and I'm from Kodungaiyur, Chennai. I graduated
            with a Bachelor's in Computer Applications from Thiruthangal Nadar
            College in 2021. After completing my graduation, I joined a BPO,
            where I worked for 1.6 years. However, during this time, I realized
            my passion lies in software development. As a result, I proactively
            decided to upskill myself by taking software courses related to my
            skills.
